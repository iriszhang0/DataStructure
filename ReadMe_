The overall structure of our programming:

We divide the project into eight classes. In the following, we will explain the function of each class.

1ï¼‰Tuple
a. We define six private fields, four of which are the characteristics of the Tuple. 
b. In order to get and modify them, we define getter and setter methods. c. For the purpose of comparison, we define a Compare method which first based on the priority of the Tuple to return True/False, if the priorities of the two Tuple are the same, we compare the insertion time. 
d. In order to print the required format, we write a ToString()method to simple print the Tuple. 

2) SortedUnboundedArray
a. We define our own sorted unbounded array without using Java Built-in. 
b. We define method reallocate() to grow the size of the array, grow() to add element to the array, shrink() to delete element of the array, sort()to sort the array. And each time we add element to the array, we will sort it so that deletion becomes simple, we just delete the "largest" element in the array.

3) LinkedList 
a. We define our own linked list without using Java Built-in. 
b. We define getter and setter to get and modify the fields.
c. We define size() to get the current size of the linkedlist, FindAt(i) to find the element at the index i, FindKey(k) to find the node which key is k, InsertPlace(k) to find the place that k should be inserted in so that the linkedlist is sorted. 
d. For insertion and deletion, we both put them into two different cases: at head and elsewhere. In order to insert, we write a helper method getPred() to find the predecessor of the current Node. 
e. After each insertion, we add 1 to the currentsize; after each deletion, we minus 1 to the currentsize. 

4)HashTable 
a. We define our own hash table without using Java Built-in. 
b. We define size() to return the number of current elements in the hash table. 
c. In order to delete, we write the helper method FindMax() to return the maximum element in the hash table, in which we first use FindFirst() to find the first element in the table. 
d. For insertion, we always insert the element in the head. 
e. After each insertion, we add 1 to the currentsize; after each deletion, we minus 1 to the currentsize. 

5)PriorityQueue
a. We define our own priority queue without using Java Built-in. 
b. In order to make the heap, we write SiftDown() to sort the heap.
c. Each time we do the insertion or deletion we will get a heap. 
d.We define Getnumitem() to return the number of current elements in the hash table. 
e. After each insertion, we add 1 to the currentsize; after each deletion, we minus 1 to the currentsize. 

6)Generator 
First, we define a constructor that initializes varibales and take in parameters. 
Then, to generate requests, we write a method. In this method, we first check which data structure is used. Then, we check whether all processes are blocked. If they are all blocked or the data struture is full, we will let generator sleep. After that, we start to generate request. 
First, we check whether we get the total number of requests and if the generator needs to sleep (two situations). Then, for each batch, we randomly generate requests with same insertion time and we will get a different random process_id for each request and non of them are the same as the one already in the data structure. Then, we insert the request into the data structure by calling the method defined in our own data structure. Then, we will write the current characteristics of the request (Tuple) to the output file. After each batch, we let the generator sleep for a random time up to 100ms. We keep on generating request until it has enough requests. 

7) Scheduler
The same as generator, we define a constructor that initializes varibales and take in parameters.
Then, to process requests, we write a method. In this method, we first check which data structure is used. Then, we check whether the data structure is empty. If not, we delete the maximum element in the data structure. If the resource is avaiable, we will first make it unavaiable and then spawn a thread and let it sleep for the required time. Both the start and end of this thread, we will write the current characteristics of the request (Tuple) to the output file. Repeat this process until the number of requests is completed. 

8)Application 
In the application class, we mainly build the main method to run the program. First, we declare four data structure and initialize them. Then, we create an array to store resources, the index shows the number of resource. The value stored in the array shows whether the resource is available(0) or occupied(1) and we initialize to be all available. Then, we create an array to show the accessibility of the processor_id and initialize to 0 to indicate available. At last, we spawn the threads to run generator and scheduler.
